This repo contains a proof-of-concept for adding React Native to an existing Flutter app for iOS and Android.

It contains a basic Flutter app with added React Native brownfield integration. It leverages both platforms' abilities to host native platform views, which serve as the briding layer. 

## Scope

- [x] Basic React Native brownfield setup
- [x] Added some popular React Native libraries:
  - [x] React Navigation
  - [x] Reanimated
  - [x] React Native WebView
- [x] Functioning hot reload for both React Native and Flutter

## Running

1. Run `yarn install`
2. Install Cocoapods: `cd ios; pod install`
3. Start Metro bundler in the root folder: `yarn start`
4. Open the root folder in VS Code
5. In VS Code, open `main.dart` and open Run -> Start Debugging menu option
