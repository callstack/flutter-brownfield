<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callstack/flutter-brownfield/main/docs/images/flutter-react-love.png" />

This repository contains a proof-of-concept for adding React Native to an existing Flutter app.

This app is a basic Flutter app with added React Native brownfield integration. It leverages both platforms' abilities to host native platform views, which serve as the briding layer. 

## Scope

* Basic React Native brownfield setup
* Added some popular React Native libraries: React Navigation, Reanimated, React Native WebView.
* Working hot reload for both React Native and Flutter
