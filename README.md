# Flutter app with React Native brownfield setup

This is a model setup for adding React Native to an existing Flutter app.

I've used basic template Flutter app to keep things simple and easy-to-understand. Relevant parts of code are annotated for easier reading. This example uses the latest versions of Flutter (3.22) and React Native (0.74.3) at the time of writting.

## Setup process

This app has been created from Flutter template, and then I've added iOS and Android integration for React Native based on following documenentation:

- [Flutter docs: Host a native iOS view](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/ios/platform-views)
- [Flutter docs: Host a native Android view](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/android/platform-views)
- [React Native docs: Integration with Existing Apps](https://reactnative.dev/docs/integration-with-existing-apps)
- [React Native docs: Integration with Android Fragment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/integration-with-android-fragment)
